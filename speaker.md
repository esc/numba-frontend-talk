Valentin is a long-time "Python for Data" user and developer who still
remembers hearing Travis Oliphant's keynote at the EuroScipy 2007. This was
during a time where he first became aware of the nascent scientific Python
stack. He started using Python for simple modeling of spiking neurons and
evaluation of data from perception experiments during his Masters degree in
computational neuroscience. Since then he has been active as a contributor
across more than 75 open source projects. For example, within the Blosc
ecosystem where he contributed to Python-Blosc and Bloscpack. Furthermore, he
has acquired significant experience as a Git trainer and consultant and had
published the first German language book about the topic in 2011. In 2014 and
2015 he helped kickstart the PyData Berlin community alongside a few other
volunteers and co-organized the first two editions of the PyData Berlin
Conference. He now works for Anaconda as a software engineer / open source
developer on the Numba project.
