Redesigning the Numba Frontend for Rapidly Changing Python Bytecode

The advent of the new Python release policy has resulted in a number of
challenges for the Numba project. Numba uses the Python bytecode as an input to
Just-In-Time (JIT) compile Python functions. Unfortunately the bytecode was
never designed to be stable and was not intended to serve as a public
interface. As such the bytecode implementation is subject to constant change
with every new Python minor version, new bytecodes are regularly introduced and
the behaviour of existing byetcodes themselves may change in subtle, sometimes
non-documented ways. While this flexibility is advantageous in terms of
performance for the CPython interpreter it does create additional work for any
project attempting to consume the bytecode.

The challenge that Numba faces is that significant work is needed every year in
order to support the latest Python minor version. While this work is indeed
principled, usually some decisions need to be taken which lead to an increase
in Numba's code complexity. For example, sometimes bytecode sequences need to
be rewritten, such that they match an older minor version of Python where the
bytecode sequence was less complicated. In this talk I will introduce a new
approach, based on formal methods, to regularize (or canonicalize) Python
bytecode and thus transform any bytecode into a predictable and stable format.

The approach is inspired by recent publications in theoretical computer science
related to the construction of so-called Regionalized State Value Dependency
Graphs (RVSDGs). The Numba implementation does not use RVSDGs directly,
instead we have discovered an intermediary representation introduced in
Bahmann2015[1] that is sufficient for Numba's needs. The basic idea is to take
the bytecode as generated by CPython, which effectively describes a Control
Flow Graph (CFG) of basic blocks and transform this into a canonical form. Some
features of this format are the clear identification of branching (if-else)
regions and looping (for, while) regions as well as the insertion of synthetic
blocks such that all regions are closed ("closed" in this context means: there
is only a single entry edge/arc and single exit edge/arc from any given
region). As a result much of Numba's  bytecode resequencing (peephole
(de)optimizers) can be removed and this significantly simplifies much of the
dataflow analysis.

In this talk I will present the theoretical approach to regularizing bytecode
based on RVSDGs, supplemented by examples and snippets from the Numba code-base.
I will further explain how this new form allows Numba to be specialised for
any given Python minor version and how it relinquishes the need for complex
code. Looking into the future, I will present potential opportunities for
tools such as JAX, PyTensor and others to consume this form. This would
establish the form as a common intermediary representation of the bytecode for
any given minor version.  This means that consumers would receive a
computationally equivalent CFG representation irrespective of the Python minor
version used.  Ideally the Python minor bytecode version would thus be
abstracted away leading to simplification for any tools
attempting to consume a Python program in its bytecode representation.
Furthermore, the implementation has been designed in a way that the payload
itself can be abstracted away, such that the representation is independent of
Python itself. Thus it is conceivable to transform the bytecode of any other
programming language or perhaps even an alternative program representation such
as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into the new form. This technique will enable
opportunities to open gateways into the future and will provide us with ample
possibilities for sustained research and innovation.

Furthermore, this approach is part of a larger effort to transform the Numba
project into a compiler building toolkit, that will become a framework to
enable the creation of highly specialised compilers for the dawning era of diverse
and heterogeneous silicon that our civilisation is venturing into. I will
conclude the talk with an outlook of potential innovations in compiler
technologies during the next decade and beyond!
